    <h2>PROGRAM</h2>
        <p>The Make in India initiative was launched by Prime Minister in September 2014 as part of a wider set of nation-building initiatives. Devised to transform India into a global design and manufacturing hub, Make in India was a timely response to a critical situation. By 2013, 
    the much-hyped emerging markets bubble had burst, and India’s growth rate had fallen to its lowest level in a decade. 
    The promise of the BRICS Nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) had faded, and 
    India was tagged as one of the so-called ‘Fragile Five’. Global investors debated whether the world’s 
    largest democracy was a risk or an opportunity. India’s 1.2 billion citizens questioned whether India was too big to succeed or 
    too big to fail. India was on the brink of severe economic failure, desperately in need of a big push.</p><br>
    
    <h2>PROCESS</h2>
        <p>Make in India was launched by Prime Minister against the backdrop of this crisis and quickly became a rallying cry for India’s 
        innumerable stakeholders and partners. It was a powerful, galvanising call to action to India’s citizens and business leaders,
        and an invitation to potential partners and investors around the world. But Make in India is much more than an inspiring slogan. 
        It represents a comprehensive and unprecedented overhaul of outdated processes and policies. Most importantly, 
        it represents a complete change of the government’s mindset –
         a shift from issuing authority to business partner, in keeping with Prime Minister's tenet of 
         ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance’.</p><br>
        
    <h2>FUTURE PLAN</h2>
        <p>To start a movement, you need a strategy that inspires, empowers and enables in equal measure. 
            Make in India needed a different kind of campaign: instead of the typical statistics-laden newspaper advertisements, 
            this exercise required messaging that was informative, well-packaged and most importantly, credible. 
            It had to (a) inspire confidence in India’s capabilities amongst potential partners abroad, 
            the Indian business community and citizens at large; (b) provide a framework for a vast amount of 
            technical information on 25 industry sectors; and (c) reach out to a vast local and global audience via
            social media and constantly keep them updated about opportunities, reforms, etc..<br><br>
            The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) worked with a group of highly specialised agencies 
            to build brand new infrastructure, including a dedicated help desk and a mobile-first website that packed a wide array 
            of information into a simple and sleek menu. Designed primarily for mobile screens, the site’s architecture ensured
            that exhaustive levels of detail are neatly tucked away so as not to overwhelm the user. 25 sector brochures were
            also developed - contents included key facts and figures, policies and initiatives and sector-specific contact details,
            all of which was made available in print and on the website.</p>
